1. What does it do?
    It is a To-Do List application, allowing the user to add, remove, update, and view tasks that the user has

2. How does it work?
    The program prompts the user to select a number, from 1 to 5.
   upon selecting a number, the user is given another prompt depending on the number selected.
   1 is to add a task, 2 is to view the task list, 3 is to mark a task as complete, 4 is to delete a
   task from the list, and 5 is to exit the program.

3. Exception Handling
     In order to prevent the program from crashing and to allow it to run smoothly, exception handling
   has been implemented. This allows incorrect or invalid inputs to be handled appropriately by letting
   the user know that their input is invalid. And instead of crashing and the user having to reset their
   list, they can continue their list as if nothing happened.
